# Web Scraping with Python
This Python script demonstrates how to scrape data from a website using requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. It specifically scrapes links (<a> tags) from the "World Population" page on Worldometers and saves the extracted data into a CSV file.

## Project Overview
The script fetches the HTML content from the Worldometers World Population page, extracts all the links (anchor tags, <a>), and saves the link text and URLs into a CSV file called scraped_links.csv.

## Features
Send an HTTP request to a specified website.
Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
Extract all the anchor (<a>) tags with their respective URLs.
Save the extracted link data into a CSV file for further analysis.
Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

requests: For sending HTTP requests.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content.
csv: For writing the extracted data to a CSV file.
To install these dependencies, you can use pip:


pip install requests beautifulsoup4

## Installation
Clone this repository or create a new Python file (e.g., web_scraper.py).
Install required dependencies:
Open a terminal (or Anaconda Prompt) and run:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4
Ensure you have access to the target URL (in this case, https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).

## Usage
Step 1: Save the Script
Save the provided Python script to a file, e.g., web_scraper.py.

Step 2: Run the Script
Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, run the script by executing:

python web_scraper.py
Step 3: Check the Output
After running the script, the data will be saved in a file named scraped_links.csv in the same directory where the script is located. The CSV will contain the following columns:

Link Text: The text content of the <a> tag (the clickable part of the link).
URL: The URL associated with the <a> tag (the value of the href attribute).
You can open the CSV file in any text editor, spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets), or further process it with Python for analysis.

## Example Output in scraped_links.csv
Link Text	URL
World Population	https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/
Countries	https://www.worldometers.info/countries/
...	...
## How the Script Works
Step-by-step Breakdown:
Send an HTTP Request: The script uses the requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the website (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).


response = requests.get(url)
Parse HTML Content: If the request is successful (status code 200), the HTML content of the page is parsed using BeautifulSoup:


soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
Extract Links: The script looks for all <a> tags on the page, which define hyperlinks. It extracts the text inside each tag (link.get_text()) and the href attribute (link.get('href')), which is the URL:


links = soup.find_all('a')
Save Data to CSV: The script writes the extracted links (link text and URL) to a CSV file named scraped_links.csv:

`
with open('scraped_links.csv', mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Link Text', 'URL'])  # Write headers
    for link in links:
        writer.writerow([link.get_text(), link.get('href')])
Completion Message: After the data has been saved, a success message is displayed to the user:
`

print("Scraping complete! Data saved in 'scraped_links.csv'.")
Error Handling
If the script is unable to retrieve the page (e.g., due to a 404 or 500 error), an error message will be shown indicating the failure:


print("Failed to retrieve the page. Status code:", response.status_code)

BeautifulSoup: For HTML parsing and web scraping.
Requests: For sending HTTP requests in Python.

## Notes:
Customization: You can modify the script to scrape other websites or specific types of data (such as tables, images, or specific sections) by adjusting the soup.find_all() method to target different HTML elements.
Limitations: Some websites may block scraping or require headers (e.g., User-Agent) to appear as a browser. Always check a website's terms of service and robots.txt before scraping.
